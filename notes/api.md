🌍 API Overview
📌 What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It acts as a bridge between a client (such as a web or mobile app) and a server (where data is stored).

📌 How APIs Work
Client Sends a Request → A user or app requests data from the API.
Server Processes the Request → The API fetches the required data.
Server Responds → The API returns data in a structured format, usually JSON or XML.
🔹 Example: A weather app calls a weather API to get temperature data.

📌 Types of APIs
API Type	Description
REST API	Uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
SOAP API	Uses XML-based messaging for communication.
GraphQL API	Allows clients to request specific data fields.
📌 REST API Example (Blog API)
Here’s an example of RESTful API endpoints for a blog system:

HTTP Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/posts	Fetch all posts
GET	/posts/1	Fetch a specific post
POST	/posts	Create a new post
PUT	/posts/1	Update an existing post
DELETE	/posts/1	Delete a post
📌 Example JSON Response from API
json
Copy
Edit
{
    "id": 1,
    "author": "youssef",
    "category": "tech",
    "title": "Deep Seek AI",
    "content": "Deep learning innovations in AI..."
}
📌 Why Use APIs?
✅ Automate data exchange
✅ Integrate with third-party services
✅ Improve scalability and flexibility
✅ Allow different applications to communicate efficiently

📌 How to Use an API?
Read the API documentation 📖
Use tools like Postman to test API requests 🛠
Implement API calls in code using fetch (JavaScript), requests (Python), etc.
