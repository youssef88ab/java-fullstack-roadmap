# 🌐 API (Application Programming Interface) Overview

## 🔹 What is an API?
An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define **how requests and responses should be structured** and enable developers to interact with external services, databases, and other systems.

## 🔹 Types of APIs:
1. **REST API**: Uses HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` for communication.
2. **SOAP API**: Uses XML-based messaging and operates over HTTP, SMTP, etc.
3. **GraphQL API**: A flexible API that allows clients to request only the data they need.
4. **WebSocket API**: Enables real-time communication between the client and server.

## 🔹 REST API Example:
A typical **REST API** request and response:

### ✅ Request:
```http
GET /posts/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json
✅ Response:
json

    "category": "tech",
    "title": "Deep Seek AI",
    "content": "Deep learning innovations in AI..."
}
🔹 Common HTTP Methods:
Method	Description
GET	Retrieve data from the server.
POST	Send data to the server to create a resource.
PUT	Update an existing resource.
DELETE	Remove a resource from the server.
🔹 API Authentication Methods:
API Key: A unique identifier used to authenticate requests. (e.g., Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY)
OAuth 2.0: A widely-used open standard for access delegation (e.g., used by Google, Facebook).
JWT (JSON Web Token): A secure authentication method often used for stateless authentication.
Basic Auth: Involves sending the username and password in the request header.
🔹 API Response Status Codes:
Code	Meaning
200 OK	The request was successful.
201 Created	The resource was successfully created.
400 Bad Request	The request was malformed or invalid.
401 Unauthorized	Authentication failed.
403 Forbidden	The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
404 Not Found	The requested resource could not be found.
500 Internal Server Error	The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
🔹 Example of a POST Request:
✅ Request:

}
🔹 API Documentation Tools:
Swagger / OpenAPI: Standardized tool for documenting REST APIs and generating client libraries.
Postman: A platform for testing and managing APIs.
RapidAPI: An API marketplace where you can discover, test, and connect to APIs.
